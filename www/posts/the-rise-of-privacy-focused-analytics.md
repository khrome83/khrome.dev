Privacy is become a bigger concern in users mind. Every week it seems that a new scandal is surfacing over at Facebook that is making headlines. Or we have a smart gadget that is revealed to have a hidden microphone. Zoom's teleconference software was recently revealed to secretly install a hidden unsecured server without a users consent. Frequently, the news headlines are teaching us that we can not trust the big tech companies to handle our information correctly. 

Changes are happening. The EU signed the GDPR in 2016, the biggest data privacy regulation in over 20 years. But it's not enough. Yes, Facebook announced on the switch to be a privacy focused company, but they rely on ad revenue. 

How can we trust these mega corporations to power our analytics and give us actionable insights without exploiting the data? There is a reason Google Analytics is free. The data they collect is the payment, and then some. It's time we are responsible to our users.
