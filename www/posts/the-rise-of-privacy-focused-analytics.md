Privacy is growing to be a bigger concern in users mind. Every week it seems that a new scandal is surfacing over at Facebook that is making headlines. Or we have a smart gadget that is revealed to have a hidden microphone. Zoom's teleconference software was recently revealed to secretly install a hidden unsecured server without a users consent. Frequently, the news headlines are teaching us that we can not trust the big tech companies to handle our information correctly.

Changes are happening. The EU signed the GDPR in 2016, the biggest data privacy regulation in over 20 years. But it's not enough. Yes, Facebook announced on the switch to be a privacy focused company, but they rely on ad revenue.

How can we trust these mega tech corporations to power our analytics and give us actionable insights without exploiting the data? There is a reason Google Analytics is free. The data they collect is the payment, and then some. It's time we are responsible to our users.

## The Data We Need

The point of website analytics is to delve information that is meaningful to understand about our users. The information we need boils down to a few themes. 

1. We need to understand growth. 
2. We need to understand some basics about our audience. 
3. We need to understand what technology we need to support.

### Growth

This is pretty basic concept that has been a staple since the early days of the web. Are we gaining or loosing visitors? Where are those visitors going on our site? How are they getting to our site? 

### Demographics

As the internet grew and sites became more global, we started asking about our users. What countries do these visitors come from? Are we supporting the locales correctly?

### Technology

As web technologies exploded, devices changed, and access expanded, we needed to understand how to support our audience. What browsers are they using? What devices did they connect from? What was the screen size of those devices?

### The Cost of Privacy

Privacy focused solutions tend to capture a lot less data. Does this make them less beneficial? Maybe. But it depends on your specific needs. Analytics suites tend to have a lot of tools that go underused and don't serve many of the users. But you pay for them with the data you capture about your users. 

Most of this information you need can be seen in privacy focused tools. The difference? You give up some demographic data around age or gender, viewing habits, and other invasive data points. 

Privacy focused analytics also typically have a slightly higher cost. Either charging a monthly fee, unlike the free Google Analytics. Or requiring self hosting, infrastructure, and technical setup. You will have to judge for yourself if you can live without the features, or do the setup. But the result is you will be no longer tracking unneeded data about your users.
